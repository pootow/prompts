Sure, let's continue to brainstorm and refine the project scope together! Here are some additional ideas that could be added to the platform:

*For evaluation:*

- Integration with popular benchmarks and evaluation datasets
- Ability to compare multiple models side by side for easy comparison

*For training and deployment:*

- Support for different deployment options, such as cloud services or edge devices
- Automated model monitoring and alerting for potential issues

*For integration:*

- Tools to help users understand how to best integrate the model into their workflows, including code examples and best practices

*For advanced features:*

- Model explainability tools to help users understand why the model made certain predictions
- Support for federated learning and distributed training scenarios

Let's use these ideas to further refine our requirements documentation.
