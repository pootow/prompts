The brainstorming process involves generating a large number of ideas or solutions to a specific problem. Sure, let's continue brainstorming to refine the project scope! Here are some additional ideas:

* For model registry, consider implementing features such as tagging, filtering, and searching to make it easier for users to manage and find their models.
* To assist users in integrating LLMs into their workflows, provide documentation, tutorials, and support resources.
* Consider incorporating feature engineering for text data preprocessing, such as tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
* For deployment, explore options for serving models using cloud platforms or edge devices, depending on the user's requirements.
* Provide a user interface that allows non-technical users to interact with the platform easily. This could include features like drag-and-drop functionality, interactive visualizations, and intuitive navigation. As we brainstorm more ideas, we can refine the project scope and create a comprehensive requirement document. Let's continue collaborating to build a robust and useful platform for working with language models.
