
üßôüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è: Thank you for providing the background and brainstorming details for your project. Let's continue refining the project scope and work on comprehensive requirement documentation. To do this, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Gather More Context**: Can you provide specific objectives and goals for each of the four points you mentioned (Evaluating open source LLMs, Training of fine-tuning, Deploying models, and Customer integration)? This will help us create more precise requirements.

The motivation of evaluating open source LLMs is that customers want to have their own model to keep their data private, so they eager to find a *best* model for their needs. We can provide tools for user to evaluate various open source models.

2. **Determine Key Features**: Based on the brainstorming, let's identify the key features for each module or aspect of the project. What are the essential functionalities for data preparation, evaluation, model development, and deployment?

3. **Workflow Considerations**: Could you elaborate on the workflow aspects? What tools or mechanisms do you envision for versioning, reproducibility, and snapshot capture in the research and production phases?

Once we have a clearer picture of these aspects, we can draft comprehensive requirement documentation. This is very important to me.
